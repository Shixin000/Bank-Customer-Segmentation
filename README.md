# Unsupervised Machine Learning for Customer Segmentation
Goal: train unsupervised machine learning algorithms to perform customer market segmentation. I will use K-means method to divide a group of bank customer in to four groups:
Transactors: the customers who pay least amount of intrerest charges and careful with their money
revolvers: the customers who use credit card as a loan. This group is most lucrative sector for the bank since they pay 20% interest.
VIP/Prime: the customers with high credit limit/% of full payment; targeted to increase their credit limit/spending.
New customers: the customers with low tenure and low balance who can be targeted to enroll in other bank services(ex: travel credit card)
